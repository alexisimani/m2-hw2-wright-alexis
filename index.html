    <h1>Hi, I'm Alexis Wright!</h1>
        <h2>Early Years</h2>
            <h3>Hometown</h3>
                <p>Charleston, South Carolina</p>
            <h3>High School Extracurriculars</h3>
                <p>While in high school, my interest in art really began to flourish. Before my freshman year, I had particpated in a music camp where we created a band and had a showcase in the end. We got to create our own band tshirts and experiment with many different instruments. My main questions was, "What will we wear?"
                I created the design for our band, Sternum, t-shirt which we all got to screenprint together. It was alot of fun and after that I would make sketches all the time. My favorite show was Project Runway and I would make my own sketches based on the contestant's weekly challenges. 
                I also gained an interest in business and was able to get on the Executive Board of DECA, the school's entrprenuership and business organization. I'm glad that I aprticipated in this as I got a great scholarship in college for being a part of it. </p>
        <h2>College Years</h2>
             <p>When I was deciding where I would go to college, I had two questions: 
                <ol>
                 <li>Is Fashion Merchandising offered as a Major?</li>
                 <li>Do they have great study abroad programs?</li>
                 </ol> 
             My friends and some family members were not happy about my short checklist for a college. They said things like "You don't care about the sports/party life/sororities??" or "Maybe you should try someothing less specific."
             I didn't let that stop me and chose a small school in a nice city just 3 hours away from my hometown: Johnson and Wales Unviversity in Charlotte, NC. I learned alot during this time both in and outside of the classroom. 
             <h3>College Highlights</h3> 
             <!--Shark Fest Competition-->
             <img src="images/shark fest.JPG" alt="Shark Fest Competition" width="300" height="300"/>
             <p>In 2017, I won 2nd Place in my school's business pitch competition called Shark Fest! It was a great learning experience and I was so excited about my business idea. Hatima was a monthly subscription based service that would promote small black owned beauty/skin care businesses. The competition had an intense application process and not all ideas were chosen to be presented at the showcase. Leading up to the competition, we were all assigned a mentor who helped us with our presentation. 
                 This program was a great look into what entrprenuership is and I was honored to be apart of it. Learn more about it here: <a href="https://www.jwu.edu/news/2022/04/what-is-jwu-sharkfest.html" target="_blank">JWU SharkFest</a></p>
             <!--Wildcat Statue-->
             <img src="images/wildcat statue.JPG" alt="Wildcat Statue" width="300" height="300"/>
             <p>On campus, it was tradition to take a photo in front of Wildact statue at the beginning of the year to mark a New Beginning</p>
             <!--Berlin, Germany-->
             <img src="images/berlin 2017.JPG" alt="Berlin with Friends 2017" width="300" height="300"/>
             <p>I was able to visit Berlin, Germany during my first study abroad experience. Getting there was my first time on a plane! I met amazing people and created long lasting friendships during this trip.</p>
             <!--Paris, France Trip #1-->  
             <img src="images/paris trip 2017.jpg" alt="Paris-Eiffel Tower 2017" width="325" height="500"/>
             <p>I took a weekend trip to Paris while I was studying in Berlin. Seeing the Eiffel Tower in person for the first time was an unforgettable moment.</p>
             <!--London Fashion Week Internship-->
             <img src="images/london fashion week internship.JPG" alt="London Fashion Week Internship" width="300" height="300"/>
             <p>During my second study abroad experience, I visited London, England. I had the awesome oppurtunity to intern during London Fashion Week which was so much fun and eye-opening. I was able to see all that goes into a  successful fashion show. I really enjoyed being a part of it and know that one day instead of a staff member, I will be a guest at fashion shows. </p>
             <!--Graduation Photo-->
             <img src="images/graduation 2020.jpeg" alt="2020 Gradutation Photo w/ Diploma" width="300" height="400"/>
             <p>I finished my senior year 1 semester early in Winter 2019, but my school didn't have a separate Winter and Spring ceremonies. Unfortunately, I was unable to walk across the stage due to Covid 19 Restrictions in May 2020. My mom and I visited a beautiful park and she took this pic of me with my diploma to celebrate my accomplishment.</p>

    <h2>Post Undergraduate Life and Career Goals</h2>
        <h3>Present Day</h3>
            <p>Currently, I work as a remote customer service representative for Coach, the luxury leather goods company. It can be very challenging because I am dealing with complaints from 
            disgruntled people. This job has taught me alot about professionalism and conflict resolution. Before making the leap into tech I thought that I would be a Fashion Buyer, but after completing an internship in the field I decided that it wasn't the right career for me.
            I see my customer service job as a stepping stone towards my future career and not the final destination. I work 10hrs/4days a week so I am able to have 3 whole days to focus on the UX Design bootcamp I'm participating in and my Web Design Master's degree program. I believe in hard work and know that it will pay off in the future. I manage my time wisely because it is my most valuable asset right now. </p>
        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>By the beginning of Summer 2023, my UX Design Bootcamp will be over. Gratfeully, this program has Career Services so they will assist me with my LinkedIn profile, resume, and job search. By the end of Summer 23, I will have my first UX Design or UX Research role. From there, I will gain more coding/front end development skills and perfect my portfolio so that I can get my first job as a front end web developer. 
                Ultimately, I want to work for a great company as a Senior Front End Web Developer. I see myself as a future leader and know that I can make my mark on the tech industry.
